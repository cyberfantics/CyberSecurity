# Image Encryption/Decryption

## Description:
This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using a simple XOR encryption technique. It was developed by Syed Mansoor ul Hassan Bukhari.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## How to Use:

### 1. Running the Program:
- Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the PIL library if you haven't already (`pip install pillow`).
- Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., `image_encrypt_decrypt.py`).
- Run the Python file using your preferred method (command line, IDE, etc.).

### 2. Using the Program:
- Upon running the program, you'll be presented with a menu.
- Choose an option:
  - **Encrypt an image**: Enter the path to the image you want to encrypt and provide an encryption key (an integer).
  - **Decrypt an image**: Enter the path to the image you want to decrypt and provide the corresponding decryption key (an integer).
  - **Exit**: Terminate the program.

### 3. Encrypting an Image:
- Choose the option to encrypt an image.
- Enter the full path to the image file you want to encrypt.
- Provide an encryption key (an integer).
- The program will encrypt the image using XOR encryption and save the result as a new image file.

### 4. Decrypting an Image:
- Choose the option to decrypt an image.
- Enter the full path to the encrypted image file you want to decrypt.
- Provide the decryption key used to encrypt the image.
- The program will decrypt the image using XOR decryption and save the result as a new image file.

### 5. Exiting the Program:
- Select the option to exit the program to terminate its execution.

Feel free to experiment with the program to encrypt and decrypt images with different encryption keys!
